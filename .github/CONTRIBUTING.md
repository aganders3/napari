## Workflows and actions

There are over 20 GitHub workflows found in `.github/workflows`.
The team creates a workflow to automate manual actions and steps.
This results in improved accuracy and quality. Some key workflows:
- `actionlint.yml` does static testing of GitHub action workflows
- benchmarks
- `tests.yml` runs the test suite across the supported Python x Qt-backend x OS
  matrix using the pixi environments defined in `pixi.toml` / `pixi.lock`. It
  auto-selects a fast PR subset on pull requests and the full matrix on pushes
  to `main` (with a `workflow_dispatch` toggle). Per-cell steps live in the
  `.github/actions/pixi-test` composite action.
- `checks.yml` holds the non-test PR checks (import-lint, check-manifest, i18n
  syntax, PR benchmarks) and the post-merge `main` -> `napari-bot` mirror.
- `upgrade_test_constraints.yml` automates upgrading the remaining constraint
  files (docs and mypy) via `tools/compile_constraints.sh`. It also has
  extensive commenting on what the upgrade process entails.

If adding a workflow, please take a moment to explain its purpose at the
top of its file.

## Templates

Used to provide a consistent user experience when submitting an issue or PR.
napari uses the following:
- `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
- `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` directory containing:
   - `config.yml` to add the menu selector when "New Issue" button is pressed
   - `design_related.md`
   - `documentation.md`
   - `feature_request.md`
   - `bug_report.yml` config file to provide text areas for users to complete for bug reports.
- `FUNDING.yml`: redirect GitHub to napari NumFOCUS account
- Testing and bots
   - `missing_translations.md`: used if an action detects a missing language translation
   - `dependabot.yml`: opens a PR to notify maintainers of updates to dependencies
   - `labeler.yml` is a labels config file for labeler action
   - `BOT_REPO_UPDATE_FAIL_TEMPLATE.md` is an bot failure notification template
   - `TEST_FAIL_TEMPLATE.md` is a test failure notification template
